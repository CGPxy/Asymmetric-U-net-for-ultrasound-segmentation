## Asymmetric-U-net-for-ultrasound-segmentation

[Asymmetric U-shaped network with hybrid attention mechanism for kidney ultrasound images segmentation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.118847)

In this study, we rethink the impact of asymmetric coding-decoding network on ultrasound image segmentation. Inspired by [CBAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06521), we designed a hybrid attention module to strengthen the characterization of the objective.
